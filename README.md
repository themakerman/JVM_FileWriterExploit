"# JVM_FileWriterExploit" 


Description: FileWriter class in java is used to write stream of characters to a particular File. The feature of filewriting is used to create a ghost file (cannot be detected by victim as common extension aliases like .dll, etc are used) in secondary disk drives like HDD,
pendrive, etc connected to the computer while this program is executed. Once this file is created random garbage characters are dumped into the file, thus increasing the file size after few minutes to GBâ€™s thereby decreasing the disk drive space. This forces the user to
clean up the disk drive as it becomes very difficult for file to get located or to know the reason why the drive became full. The exploit can be used as social engieering tool to make the user believe that hdd is full which forces him to create a backup on external drives.
Once external drive gets connected to other computers, an httpRequest can be programmed in the same file to download a payload. This payload can be malicious and can be used to access any computer to which this external drive gets connected. Technology: Java, Theory of Java Virtual Machine
